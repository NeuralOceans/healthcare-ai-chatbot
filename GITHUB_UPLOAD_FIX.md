# GitHub Upload Fix - Extract the Zip File

## Current Issue: Zip File Not Extracted

Your repository shows only the .zip file instead of the extracted files. This needs to be fixed for the deploy button to work.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Manual Extraction (Recommended)

1. **Download the zip from your repository**
2. **Extract it on your computer** 
3. **Delete the zip file from GitHub repository**
   - Go to the zip file in GitHub
   - Click the trash icon to delete it
   - Commit the deletion
4. **Upload the extracted files**
   - Use GitHub's "Add file" â†’ "Upload files" 
   - Drag all the extracted folders and files
   - Commit with message: "Healthcare AI Chatbot files"

### Option 2: Git Commands (If Available)

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/healthcare-ai-chatbot.git
cd healthcare-ai-chatbot

# Remove the zip file
rm *.zip

# Extract your project files to this directory
# (copy all files from your extracted zip here)

# Add and push
git add .
git commit -m "Healthcare AI Chatbot with one-click deployment"
git push origin main
```

## What You Should See After Fix

Your repository should contain these folders and files:
- `client/` (React frontend)
- `server/` (Node.js backend)
- `deployment/` (ARM templates)
- `README.md` (with deploy button)
- `LICENSE.txt` (educational license)
- `package.json` (dependencies)
- And other configuration files

## Next Steps After Upload

1. Edit `README.md` to replace "your-username" with your GitHub username
2. Test the "Deploy to Azure" button
3. Complete live deployment to verify functionality

The deploy button won't work until the actual project files (not the zip) are in the repository.
