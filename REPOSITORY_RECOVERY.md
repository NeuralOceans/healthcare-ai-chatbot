# Repository Recovery - Clean Setup

## Current Situation: Repository Needs Clean Setup

Your repository currently has mixed content. Here's how to create a clean, professional setup.

## Option 1: Create New Repository (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Fresh Repository
1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository
2. Name: `healthcare-ai-chatbot-v2` or `healthcare-ai-production`
3. Make it public
4. Initialize with README (check the box)

### Step 2: Upload Clean Files
1. Extract your original zip file
2. Upload only the essential project files:
   - All folders: `client/`, `server/`, `deployment/`, `shared/`, `docs/`
   - Key files: `README.md`, `LICENSE.txt`, `package.json`, `Dockerfile`
   - No zip files

## Option 2: Fix Current Repository

### Step 1: Delete Zip File
1. In your current repository, click on the zip file
2. Click delete (trash icon)
3. Commit deletion

### Step 2: Add Project Files
1. Upload extracted project files
2. Commit with clear message

## Essential Files for Deployment

Your clean repository must contain:
```
healthcare-ai-chatbot/
├── client/                 # React frontend
├── server/                 # Node.js backend
├── deployment/             # ARM templates
│   └── azuredeploy.json   # Critical for deploy button
├── shared/                 # Shared code
├── README.md              # With deploy button
├── LICENSE.txt            # Educational license
└── package.json           # Project config
```

## After Clean Setup

1. Edit README.md to use your actual GitHub username
2. Test deploy button functionality
3. Complete Azure deployment verification

## Recovery Success Criteria

- Repository shows clean folder structure
- README.md displays properly with deploy button
- ARM template accessible at correct URL
- No conflicting or duplicate files
