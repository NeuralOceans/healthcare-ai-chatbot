# Git Upload Instructions

## Your Git Commands Are Ready!

## How to Use These Commands

### Option 1: From Your Local Computer

1. **Download/Extract your project files**
   - Download the zip from Replit
   - Extract all files to a folder on your computer

2. **Open terminal/command prompt in that folder**

3. **Run your git commands:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Healthcare AI Chatbot with one-click Azure deployment"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/NeuralOceans/healthcare-ai-chatbot.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: If Your Repository Already Has Files

If you already uploaded some files to GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeuralOceans/healthcare-ai-chatbot.git
cd healthcare-ai-chatbot
# Copy all your extracted project files here
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Healthcare AI Chatbot upload"
git push origin main
```

## What Happens After Upload

Your repository will contain:
- `client/`, `server/`, `deployment/` folders
- `README.md` with deploy button
- `LICENSE.txt` with your educational license
- All configuration files

## Next Step: Update Deploy Button

After upload, edit `README.md` in GitHub to replace `your-username` with `NeuralOceans`:

```markdown
