# Add Files to Existing Repository

## Solution: Add Files Alongside the Zip

Since you can't delete the main branch, here's how to add the actual project files:

### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Extract the zip file on your computer**
2. **Go to your GitHub repository**
3. **Click "Add file" → "Upload files"**
4. **Drag all the extracted folders and files** (but NOT the zip file itself)
5. **Commit with message**: "Add Healthcare AI Chatbot files"

The zip file can stay there - it won't interfere with the deploy button.

### Method 2: Create Files One by One

If bulk upload doesn't work:
1. **Click "Add file" → "Create new file"**
2. **Type**: `README.md`
3. **Copy content** from your extracted README.md
4. **Commit the file**
5. **Repeat for other important files** like:
   - `LICENSE.txt`
   - `package.json`
   - `deployment/azuredeploy.json` (create folder by typing `deployment/azuredeploy.json`)

### Method 3: Git Commands (If Available)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/healthcare-ai-chatbot.git
cd healthcare-ai-chatbot
# Copy your extracted files here (not the zip)
git add .
git commit -m "Add Healthcare AI Chatbot files"
git push origin main
```

## What You Need at Minimum

For the deploy button to work, you absolutely need:
- `README.md` (with deploy button)
- `deployment/azuredeploy.json` (ARM template)
- `package.json` (project configuration)

Other files are helpful but not critical for the deploy button test.

## Next Steps After Upload

1. Edit `README.md` to replace "your-username" with your GitHub username
2. Test the deploy button
3. Complete Azure deployment

The zip file can remain - it won't break anything.
